# Question

What is the difference between how instance methods/properties and class methods/properties are created? What is the difference between how they are used?

# Answer
The difference between how instance methods/properties are created and how class methods/properties are created is that the keyword `static` is used to define class methods/properties while the a `constuctor function` is used to define instance methods/properties. The difference of their use is that instance methods/properties are associated with instances(objects) which is useful for accessing specific data of an instance. Class methods/properties belong and reference to the class itself and this is useful when you want to use data that is shared across all instances.
